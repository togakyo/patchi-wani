# SETUP.md — Detailed Build Instructions

> For a quick start, see [README.md](./README.md).

## Requirements

| Tool | Min version | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Rust | 1.77+ | Game engine (BE) |
| Flutter | 3.22+ | UI (FE) |
| Android Studio | Latest | Android build & emulator |
| Xcode | 15+ | iOS build (macOS only) |
| Android NDK | r25c+ | Rust → Android cross-compilation |

---

## Step 1 — Automated setup (recommended)

```bash
cd patchi-wani
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

This installs Rust and Flutter, fetches packages, and runs the Rust unit tests.

---

## Step 2 — Verify the Rust engine

```bash
cd patchi_wani_engine

# Run unit tests
cargo test

# Debug build
cargo build

# Release build
cargo build --release
```

If `cargo test` passes, the Rust side is working correctly.

---

## Step 3 — Run the Flutter app on a simulator

```bash
cd patchi_wani_flutter

# Generate platform files (first time only)
flutter create . --platforms android   # add --platforms ios on macOS if needed

# List connected devices and simulators
flutter devices

# Run on a specific device (use the device id shown by flutter devices)
flutter run -d emulator-5554   # example — replace with your device id
```

> **Note:** At this stage the Rust `.so` / `.a` library does not exist yet,
> so `EngineFFI` will throw an `UnsupportedError`.
> Complete Step 4 to build the library, then restart the app.

> **Web is not supported.** This project uses `dart:ffi` to call the Rust engine,
> which is incompatible with the web platform. Use an Android emulator or iOS simulator.

---

## Step 4 — Android cross-compilation

### 4-1. Install the Android NDK

Open Android Studio:

```
SDK Manager → SDK Tools → NDK (Side by side) → Apply
```

### 4-2. Set the NDK path environment variable

```bash
# Check which NDK version was installed
ls ~/Library/Android/sdk/ndk/   # e.g. 26.1.10909125

# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc (replace the version number with the output above)
export ANDROID_NDK_HOME="$HOME/Library/Android/sdk/ndk/26.1.10909125"  # macOS example
# Linux: export ANDROID_NDK_HOME="$HOME/Android/Sdk/ndk/26.1.10909125"

source ~/.zshrc
```

### 4-3. Build the Rust library for Android

```bash
cd patchi_wani_engine

# Use cargo-ndk (recommended — resolves the linker automatically)
cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a build --release

# Copy the .so into the Flutter project
cp target/aarch64-linux-android/release/libpatchi_wani_engine.so \
   ../patchi_wani_flutter/android/app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/
```

### 4-4. Build the Flutter APK

```bash
cd ../patchi_wani_flutter
flutter build apk --release
```

Output: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

---

## Step 5 — iOS build (macOS only)

### 5-1. Add the iOS target

```bash
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios
```

### 5-2. Build the Rust static library for iOS

```bash
cd patchi_wani_engine
cargo build --release --target aarch64-apple-ios

cp target/aarch64-apple-ios/release/libpatchi_wani_engine.a \
   ../patchi_wani_flutter/ios/Frameworks/
```

### 5-3. Link the library in Xcode

Open `patchi_wani_flutter/ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode:

1. Runner → Build Phases → Link Binary With Libraries
2. `+` → `Add Other...` → select `ios/Frameworks/libpatchi_wani_engine.a`
3. Build Settings → Other Linker Flags → add `-lc++`

### 5-4. Build the Flutter iOS app

```bash
cd patchi_wani_flutter
flutter build ios --release --no-codesign
```

---

## Step 6 — One-command builds

```bash
cd patchi-wani
chmod +x build_all.sh

./build_all.sh android   # Android APK
./build_all.sh ios       # iOS (macOS only)
./build_all.sh linux     # Linux desktop
```

## Troubleshooting

### `DynamicLibrary.open` — Cannot open shared library

The Rust library has not been built yet, or was copied to the wrong path.
Re-run Step 4-3 and verify the destination path.

### `engine_init` returns -1

JSON parse error in `GameRule`. Check that `game_rule_default.json` is valid JSON.

### `cargo ndk` not found

```bash
cargo install cargo-ndk
```

### Flutter `ffi` package error

```bash
cd patchi_wani_flutter
flutter pub get
```

### `Build failed due to use of deleted Android v1 embedding`

Android platform files are missing. Run the following to generate them:

```bash
cd patchi_wani_flutter
flutter create . --platforms android
```

### `flutter run -d android` — No supported devices found

Pass the device id directly instead of `android`:

```bash
flutter devices          # find the id (e.g. emulator-5554)
flutter run -d emulator-5554
```

### Rust tests fail

```bash
cd patchi_wani_engine
cargo test -- --nocapture   # show log output
```
